> A collection of papers on Graph Structural Learning (GSL). Will be frequently updated.

Papers about **developing deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. Investigations about **over-smoothing** and **over-squashing** problem in GNNs are also included here.

**Please feel free to submit a pull request if you want to add good papers.**
